# CrossZeroWindows
This tic-tac-toe windows game is made with [CrossZeroAPI](https://github.com/melon-code/CrossZeroAPI) using `TTCGame` for realizing players' turn logic.

Game loop and user interface are achieved with `WinForms` tools.

The game provides an option to choose game field size and type of players (computer or player).
